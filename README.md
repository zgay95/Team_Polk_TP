Team Polk's Term Project for CEN_4020 Software Engineering
This program was coded in C++, and is a collaboration between Zachary Gay, Aldric Griffin, Isaiah Wilson, and Omar Al-Badi.
You can simply run the program by clicking on the VTS.exe file, as long as you have it in the same dirctory as the files that were used to make the program.
